# Backend API Configuration
# ===========================
# 
# IMPORTANT: Set these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard:
# Settings → Environment Variables → Add Variable
#
# REQUIRED: Set both variables to your Heroku backend URL:
# - API_URL: Server-side only (secure, not exposed to client)
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Client-side (exposed to browser, needed for frontend)

# Server-side API URL (recommended for API routes - more secure)
# This is NOT exposed to the browser
# Replace with your actual Heroku backend URL
API_URL=https://your-backend-app.herokuapp.com

# Client-side API URL (required for client-side components)
# This IS exposed to the browser via Next.js
# Replace with your actual Heroku backend URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.herokuapp.com

# Local Development
# For local development, create a .env.local file with:
# API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# NOTE: Update vercel.json rewrites destination with your backend URL
# This is only used as a fallback for API routes that don't go through Next.js API handlers
