# Backend API Configuration
# ===========================
# 
# IMPORTANT: Set this environment variable in Vercel Dashboard:
# Settings → Environment Variables → Add Variable
#
# REQUIRED: Set this to your Heroku backend URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.herokuapp.com

# Local Development
# For local development, create a .env.local file with:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# NOTE: Update vercel.json rewrites destination with your backend URL
# This is only used as a fallback for API routes that don't go through Next.js API handlers
